Pages Finished!
Hurray at last i've managed to finish the pages function, done and dusted! More improvements coming soon!

Hello Pages
I've decided to make a new function that allows you to make pages which automatically get added to a menu toolbar. I will try to complete it within this week.

Bye Bye PHP
I've decided that this project will be focused on making the blog with Js instead of PHP, i will stop developing the PHP files but i will keep them in the repositorie.

First Post
Blast off, like two parallel lines, this open source blog is going to go straight with its simplisity!
