How it Works
<h3><u>Making Posts</u></h3>To make posts there must always be a extra paragraph seperating each post. The first line is the title, the second is the text, this goes with the pages file too.<h3><u>Extra Improvements</u></h3>You can insert your own HTML into each post whenever you want, just try to make it cool and creative and not too crazy destructive!
