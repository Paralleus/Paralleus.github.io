How it Works
To make posts there must always be a extra paragraph seperating each post. The first line is the title, the second is the text, this goes with this file too. The first line is the title the next is the text, after that there must be an extra empty paragraph to make sure Paralleus knows that its a different page. You can insert your own HTML into each post whenever you want, just try to make it not too destructive!
